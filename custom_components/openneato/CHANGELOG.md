# Changelog

## 1.12

### Added

- **Floorplan background for the map cameras** — the `LIDAR map` and
  `Cleaning replay` cameras can now render a user-supplied house floorplan
  (local PNG/JPG) as the background instead of the default dark grid.
  Configure the image path and calibrate origin (X/Y metres), rotation and
  scale (px/m) from **Settings → Devices & Services → OpenNeato →
  Configure**; changes apply on the next render without an HA restart. The
  metric grid is hidden while a floorplan is active. Ported the renderer to
  Pillow (HA Core already ships it, so no new dependency). Option flow added
  via `OpenNeatoOptionsFlowHandler`; options propagate to the cameras through
  an entry-reload-on-update listener.

## 1.11


### Added
- **`notify_on_start` switch** — surfaces fork PR #2's "notify on cleaning
  started" setting (`ntfyOnStart`). Firmware + frontend already supported
  the toggle; the matching HA entity was missing, so the switch row sat
  among `notify_on_done`/`error`/`alert`/`docking` with no `start` peer.
- **`ap_fallback_on_disconnect` switch** — upstream firmware #110 added
  an `apFallbackOnDisconnect` setting that brings up the captive-portal
  AP automatically when WiFi STA drops. Now configurable from HA.
- **`ntfy_topic`, `ntfy_server`, `ntfy_token` text entities** — full ntfy
  push-notification configuration is now editable from HA, no need to
  open the device web UI. Empty topic disables notifications; empty
  server defaults to `ntfy.sh`; empty token is unauthenticated.

### Not done (deliberate deferral)
- **Upstream About metadata not surfaced** — firmware commit bb7b541
  added `name`, `repositoryUrl`, `license`, `model` fields to
  `/api/firmware/version`. Threading `repository_url` through every
  entity constructor for nine platforms (vacuum, sensor, switch,
  binary_sensor, number, button, camera, select, text) just to set a
  device-info attribute was too invasive for the value it adds, and the
  `name` field already matches our hardcoded `manufacturer="OpenNeato"`.
  A cleaner future approach is a dedicated diagnostic sensor that
  exposes the full About payload as attributes.
- **Zeroconf discovery not added** — `manifest.json` was eligible for a
  `zeroconf` entry, but the firmware (`wifi_manager.cpp`) currently only
  registers the generic `_http._tcp` service. Claiming that service for
  the OpenNeato integration would match every random HTTP device on the
  LAN. When the firmware advertises a dedicated service type (e.g.
  `_openneato._tcp`), wire this up.

## 1.10

### Fixed
- **Setup crash with new firmware (`utf-8 codec can't decode byte 0xab`)** —
  Upstream firmware PR #121 added `smartBattery*` string fields to
  `/api/version` that pass raw bytes from the robot's smart-battery
  memory through the firmware's `jsonEscape()` (it only escapes bytes
  below 0x20). When the pack reports a non-UTF-8 byte, aiohttp's
  `response.json()` raised `UnicodeDecodeError` and the config entry
  failed setup. Responses are now decoded with `errors="replace"`
  before being parsed as JSON so one bad glyph can't take the
  integration down.

### Added
- **Battery diagnostics from firmware PR #121** — three new diagnostic
  sensors backed by the new `/api/analog` endpoint (battery voltage,
  current, external voltage) and two backed by `/api/warranty`
  (battery cycles, cumulative cleaning time). The existing
  `Battery temperature` sensor was repointed from the now-removed
  `/api/charger#battTempC` to `/api/analog#batteryTemperatureC`
  (a finer-grained float in °C). A `New battery` button (disabled by
  default) calls `POST /api/battery/new` to reset the fuel-gauge
  calibration after a pack swap.

## 1.9

### Fixed
- **Cameras stuck on idle placeholder** — `get_history_session` called
  `response.get_encoding()` after streaming the body via
  `response.content.read()`, which raises `RuntimeError: Cannot compute
  fallback encoding of a not yet read body` in modern aiohttp (the
  streaming path doesn't populate the response's `_body` buffer that
  the chardet fallback in `get_encoding` requires). The session
  download therefore failed for every fetch, leaving both `LIDAR map`
  and `Cleaning replay` on the polar-grid placeholder. Hardcoded UTF-8
  decoding instead — the firmware emits UTF-8 JSONL by spec, so the
  encoding-detection path was unnecessary.

  This is the root cause that 1.8's WARNING-level logging surfaced.

## 1.8

### Fixed
- **Blank camera diagnostics** — `LIDAR map` and `Cleaning replay` could
  stay on the idle polar-grid placeholder even when a valid session
  existed, because a Pillow/parser exception inside the executor would
  bubble up through `async_create_task` and only surface as an
  unhandled-task warning — easy to miss without DEBUG filtering on. The
  parse and render steps are now wrapped in `try/except` and log the
  traceback at `WARNING` so the failure is visible in the default log.
  Fetch-failure logs also moved from DEBUG to WARNING.

## 1.7

### Fixed
- **Camera entity names** — the `LIDAR map` and `Cleaning replay` camera
  entities both showed up as the bare device name (e.g. `BotVacD6Connected`)
  in the UI, making them indistinguishable. Custom integrations don't read
  `strings.json` at runtime, so the translation key alone wasn't enough;
  the display name is now set directly alongside it, matching how every
  other entity in the integration is declared.
- **LIDAR map stays blank after HA restart** — when Home Assistant started
  up with the robot already idle, the LIDAR camera fetched the latest
  completed session once and never retried. The integration now re-checks
  on every coordinator tick, so the most recent cleaning map appears as
  soon as coordinator data is available and refreshes whenever a newer
  session lands.

## 1.6

### Added
- **Cleaning replay camera** (`camera.openneato_*_motion_map`, translated as
  "Cleaning replay") — standard HA camera entity serving an animated GIF
  time-lapse of the most recent completed cleaning session. Plays once,
  then holds on the fully-drawn map so dashboards settle on a static
  final image. Works with picture-entity, vacuum-card, and other camera
  consumers. Regenerated only when a newer completed session lands.
  Coverage cells are revealed progressively in sync with path drawing.

### Fixed
- **`/api/history` robustness** — a single heatshrink-corrupted session
  file no longer breaks the HA coordinator. Previously, merged JSONL
  lines (a rare decompression artifact) produced invalid JSON in the
  listing response, causing the entire history fetch to fail and
  leaving the LIDAR camera blank and `last_clean_*` sensors as
  "unknown". Firmware now validates session/summary metadata structure
  before embedding; corrupt metadata is reported as `null`.
- **"Last clean" sensors** — now pick the most recent session by
  `summary.time` instead of relying on SPIFFS directory iteration
  order, which isn't deterministic. Fixes cases where a stale session
  was shown as the latest.

### Security
- Session filenames from the ESP32 listing are now validated against
  `\d+\.jsonl(\.hs)?` before being interpolated into the download URL,
  and response bodies are capped at 2 MB. Prevents a compromised or
  misbehaving peer on LAN from redirecting history requests to
  unrelated endpoints or OOM'ing HA Core with an unbounded stream.

### Previous changes bundled in this release (from 2c0adbc)
- Navigation mode select (Normal/Gentle/Deep/Quick)
- Remote syslog switch + syslog server IP text entity
- Wall follower switch migrated to standard `SetUserSettings WallEnable`

## 1.3.1

### Fixed
- **Coordinator resilience** — a single hung endpoint (e.g. `/api/error`
  when the robot's serial interface gets stuck on the `GetErr` command)
  no longer puts the integration into "requires attention" state. The
  coordinator now only fails when ALL critical endpoints (state, charger,
  system) time out. Non-critical endpoints fall back to their last-known
  value so the integration keeps working during transient hangs.

## 1.3.0

### Added
- **LIDAR map camera entity** — standard HA camera entity (`camera.openneato_*_lidar_map`)
  compatible with vacuum-card, picture-entity, and picture-glance cards.
  Renders the robot's 360-degree LDS scan as a 480x480 dark-theme PNG with
  wall segments, grid rings, and robot indicator. Algorithm ported from the
  standalone frontend's lidar-map.tsx (segment detection, gap bridging,
  distance smoothing, multi-scan accumulation)
- **Cleaning session history map** — when the robot is docked/idle, the camera
  automatically shows the most recent completed cleaning session map with
  coverage grid (green), path line (gold), start/end markers, and recharge
  bolt icons. Ported from the frontend's history view rendering
- **Adaptive map_source attribute** — entity exposes `map_source` ("lidar",
  "history", or "idle") plus mode-specific diagnostics (rotation_speed,
  scan_quality for LIDAR; session_mode, session_duration, session_area for
  history maps)
- **Self-managed LIDAR polling** — camera fetches `/api/lidar` independently
  at 2-second intervals only when the robot is actively cleaning. Stops
  polling when idle to avoid wasting ESP32 serial bandwidth. Zero additional
  load on the coordinator's 5-second cycle
- **Session JSONL download** — `get_history_session()` API method to fetch
  raw JSONL pose data from `/api/history/<file>` with heatshrink corruption
  recovery

### Changed
- **No firmware changes required** — uses existing `/api/lidar` and
  `/api/history/<file>` endpoints. No flash needed to upgrade from 1.2.0

### Note on camera.py removal in 1.2.0
The previous camera entity (removed in 1.2.0) rendered only cleaning paths
and pulled Pillow as a declared dependency (~20MB). This new implementation
takes a fundamentally different approach: Pillow is already a core HA
dependency (no manifest entry needed), rendering is split into standalone
modules that run in the executor, and LIDAR polling is self-managed rather
than added to the coordinator. The architecture was evaluated by a
cross-functional review covering ESP32 performance constraints, HA camera
platform conventions, vacuum-card compatibility, and UX considerations.

## 1.2.0

### Added
- **Last clean stats sensors** — 6 new sensors from cleaning history session summaries:
  - Last clean duration, area covered, distance traveled
  - Last clean battery used, cleaning mode, end timestamp
- **Entity translations** — complete `strings.json` with translations for all 35 entities
  across sensor, binary_sensor, switch, button, and number platforms

### Changed
- **Single coordinator** — merged dual fast/slow coordinators into one polling all
  endpoints at 5s. The firmware's AsyncCache handles per-endpoint TTL deduplication
  (charger 30s, user_settings 5min), so cache hits return instantly without serial bus access
- **Modernized API client** — replaced deprecated `async_timeout` with `asyncio.timeout`
- **Format filesystem button** — moved to diagnostic category and disabled by default
  to prevent accidental data loss
- **Sensor metadata** — added `state_class` to heap and storage sensors for long-term
  statistics support

### Removed
- **camera.py** — removed Pillow-based map rendering (~20MB dependency). Map rendering
  belongs in the frontend layer as a Lovelace card (tracked in #37)
- **translations/en.json** — duplicate of strings.json; HA auto-generates translations
  for custom components
- **brand/ directory** — not loaded by HA for custom integrations (only for core
  integrations in the home-assistant/brands repo)
- **Pillow dependency** — `requirements` is now empty

### Fixed
- **Translation keys** — 29 translation keys were declared in entity code but never
  defined in strings.json (dead code). All now properly defined
